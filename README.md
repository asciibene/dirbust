# dirbust
DirBust is a python tool that will help you find hidden ressources on any website you want.

It does that by bruteforce requesting for filename inside a wordlist (Any wordlist can be used) and checks the http code to tell if it's a hit or a miss. It is certainly not a bulletproof method to map out a website, and theres always room for improvement
